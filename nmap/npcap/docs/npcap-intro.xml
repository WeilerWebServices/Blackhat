  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This Manual describes the programming interface and the source code of
    Npcap. It provides detailed descriptions of the functions and structures
    exported to programmers, along with complete documentation of the Npcap
    internals. Several tutorials and examples are provided as well.</para>

  <sect2 id="npcap-description">
    <title>What is Npcap?</title>

    <para>Npcap is an architecture for packet capture and network analysis for
      Windows operating systems, consisting of a software library and a network
      driver.</para>

    <para>Most networking applications access the network through widely-used
      operating system primitives such as sockets. It is easy to access data on
      the network with this approach since the operating system copes with the
      low level details (protocol handling, packet reassembly, etc.) and
      provides a familiar interface that is similar to the one used to read and
      write files.</para>

    <para>Sometimes, however, the <quote>easy way</quote> is not up to the task,
      since some applications require direct access to packets on the network.
      That is, they need access to the <quote>raw</quote> data on the network
      without the interposition of protocol processing by the operating
      system.</para>

    <para>The purpose of Npcap is to give this kind of access to Windows
      applications. It provides facilities to:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>capture raw packets, both the ones destined to the machine where
        it's running and the ones exchanged by other hosts (on shared media)</listitem>
      <listitem>filter the packets according to user-specified rules before
        dispatching them to the application</listitem>
      <listitem>transmit raw packets to the network</listitem>
      <listitem>gather statistical information on the network traffic</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>This set of capabilities is obtained by means of a device driver,
      which is installed inside the networking portion of the Windows kernel,
      plus a couple of DLLs.</para>

    <para>All of these features are exported through a powerful programming
      interface, easily usable by applications. The main goal of this manual is
      to document this interface, with the help of several examples.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>What kind of programs use Npcap?</title>

      <para>The Npcap programming interface can be used by many types of
        network tools for analysis, troubleshooting, security and monitoring.
        In particular, classical tools that rely on Npcap are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>network and protocol analyzers</listitem>
        <listitem>network monitors</listitem>
        <listitem>traffic loggers</listitem>
        <listitem>traffic generators</listitem>
        <listitem>user-level bridges and routers</listitem>
        <listitem>network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)</listitem>
        <listitem>network scanners</listitem>
        <listitem>security tools</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>What Npcap can't do</title>

      <para>Npcap receives and sends the packets independently from the host
        protocols, like TCP/IP. This means that it isn't able to block, filter or
        manipulate the traffic generated by other programs on the same machine: it 
        simply <quote>sniffs</quote> the packets that transit on the wire. Therefore, it does not 
        provide the appropriate support for applications like traffic shapers, QoS 
        schedulers and personal firewalls. </para>

    <sect3 id="npcap-features">
      <title>Feature comparison with WinPcap</title>

      <para>Npcap carries on the WinPcap legacy, but is not without its own
        innovations. Here are some of the most exciting improvements and new
        features that Npcap adds:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>NDIS 6 Support</emphasis>: Npcap makes use of the new NDIS Lightweight Filter driver introduced in
            NDIS 6.0. This driver type is faster and has less overhead
            than the legacy <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff557012(v=vs.85).aspx">NDIS 5 Intermediate Driver</ulink>
            type used by WinPcap.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis>Latest libpcap API Support</emphasis>: Npcap provides support
            for the latest <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap">libpcap API</ulink>
            by accepting libpcap as a <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">Git submodule</ulink>.
            The latest libpcap 1.8 has integrated more fascinating features and functions than the
            <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://www.winpcap.org/misc/changelog.htm">deprecated libpcap 1.0.0 shipped by WinPcap</ulink>.
            Moreover, since Linux already has a good support for latest libpcap API, using
            Npcap on Windows facilitates your software to base on the same API on both Windows and Linux.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis><quote>Admin-only Mode</quote> Support</emphasis>: Npcap supports to restrict its
            use to Administrators for safety purpose. If Npcap is installed with
            the option <quote>Restrict Npcap driver's access to Administrators only</quote> checked,
            when a non-Admin user tries to start a user software (Nmap, Wireshark, etc),
            the <ulink role="hidepdf" url="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-user-account-control#1TC=windows-7">User Account Control (UAC)</ulink>
            dialog will prompt asking for Administrator privilege. Only when the end
            user chooses Yes, the driver can be accessed. This is similar to UNIX
            where you need root access to capture packets.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis>Loopback Packet Capture</emphasis>: Npcap is able to
            see Windows loopback packets using the
            <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366510(v=vs.85).aspx">
              Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)</ulink>. Npcap supplies an
            interface named <quote>NPF_Loopback</quote>, with the description <quote>Adapter for loopback capture.</quote>
            If you are a Wireshark user, choose this adapter
            to capture, you will see all loopback traffic the same way as other
            non-loopback adapters. Try it by typing in commands like <command>ping 127.0.0.1</command>
            (IPv4) or <command>ping ::1</command> (IPv6).</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis>Loopback Packet Injection</emphasis>: Besides loopback packet
            capturing, Npcap can also send out loopback packets using the
            <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff556958(v=vs.85).aspx">Winsock Kernel (WSK)</ulink>
            technique. A user software (e.g. Nmap) can just send packets
            on the <quote>NPF_Loopback</quote> device using
            <function>pcap_inject()</function> or
            <function>PacketSendPacket</function> just like on a standard
            interface. Npcap
            will automatically remove the packet's DLT_NULL header and
            inject the payload into Windows TCP/IP stack.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis>Raw 802.11 Packets Capture Support</emphasis>: Npcap is able to see
            <emphasis>802.11</emphasis> packets instead of <emphasis>fake Ethernet</emphasis> packets on ordinary wireless
            adapters. You need to select the <option>Support raw 802.11 traffic (and monitor
              mode) for wireless adapters</option> option in the installation wizard to enable
            this feature. When your adapter is in <quote>Monitor Mode</quote>, Npcap will supply all
            <emphasis>802.11 data + control + management</emphasis> packets with radiotap headers. When
            your adapter is in <quote>Managed Mode</quote>, Npcap will only supply <emphasis>Ethernet</emphasis>
            packets. Npcap directly supports to use Wireshark to capture in <quote>Monitor Mode</quote>.
            Meantime, Npcap also provides the <filename>WlanHelper.exe</filename>
            tool to help you switch to <quote>Monitor Mode</quote> on your own. See more details
            about this feature in section
            <quote><link linkend="npcap-feature-dot11" endterm="npcap-feature-dot11.title"/></quote>.
            See more details about radiotap here:
            <ulink role="hidepdf" url="http://www.radiotap.org/">http://www.radiotap.org/</ulink></para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><emphasis><quote>WinPcap API-compatible Mode</quote>
              Support</emphasis>: <quote>WinPcap API-compatible Mode</quote> makes Npcap a
            strict WinPcap replacement by using the same DLL location and service name as
            WinPcap. This is useful for testing or migrating from software that only uses
            WinPcap, but because Npcap is masquerading as WinPcap, software will not be
            able to be aware of and use Npcap's newer features.  It's notable that before
            installing in this mode, any existing WinPcap installation will be
            uninstalled and replaced.

    <title>Purpose of this manual</title>

    <para>The purpose of this manual is to provide a comprehensive and easy way
      to browse the documentation of the Npcap architecture. You will find
      three main sections: <xref linkend="npcap-users-guide" />,
      <xref linkend="npcap-devguide" />,
      and <xref linkend="npcap-internals" />.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="npcap-users-guide" /> is for end users of Npcap, and
      primarily concerns installation options, hardware compatibility, and bug
      reporting procedures.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="npcap-devguide" /> is for programmers who need to use
      Npcap from an application: it contains information about functions and
      data structures exported by the Npcap API, a manual for writing packet
      filters, and information on how to include it in an application. A
      tutorial with several code samples is provided as well; it can be used to
      learn the basics of the Npcap API using a step-by-step approach, but it
      also offers code snippets that demonstrate advanced features.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="npcap-internals" /> is intended for Npcap developers
      and maintainers, or for people who are curious about how this system
      works: it provides a general description of the Npcap architecture and
      explains how it works. Additionally, it documents the complete device
      driver structure, the source code, the Packet.dll interface and the
      low-level Npcap API. If you want to understand what happens inside Npcap
      or if you need to extend it, this is the section you will want to
      read.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Terminology</title>

    <para>We call Npcap an <wordasword>architecture</wordasword> rather than
      <wordasword>library</wordasword> because packet capture is a low level
      mechanism that requires a strict interaction with the network adapter and
      with the operating system, in particular with its networking
      implementation, so a simple library is not sufficient.</para>

    <para>For consistency with the literature, we will use the term
      <wordasword>packet</wordasword> even though
      <wordasword>frame</wordasword> is more accurate since the capture process
      is done at the data-link layer and the data-link header is included in
      the captured data.</para>

    <title>Npcap License</title>

    <para>Even though Npcap source code is publicly available for review, it is
      not open source software and may not be redistributed without special 
      permission from the Nmap Project. The
      <ulink url="https://github.com/nmap/npcap/blob/master/LICENSE">Npcap License</ulink>
      allows end users to download, install, and use Npcap from our site for
      free. Software providers (open source or otherwise) which want to use
      Npcap functionality are welcome to point their users to npcap.org for
      those users to download and install.</para> 
    <para>We fund the Npcap project by selling licenses to companies who wish
      to redistribute Npcap within their products. The
      <ulink url="https://nmap.org/npcap/oem/">Npcap OEM edition</ulink> allows
      companies to silently and seamlessly install Npcap during their product's
      installation rather than asking users to download and install Npcap
      themselves. The Npcap OEM commercial license also includes support,
      updates and indemnification. This is similar to the commercial licenses
      we offer for embedding <ulink url="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</ulink> in
      commercial software. More details are available from <ulink
